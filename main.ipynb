    "\n",
    "But for this project, we focused only on a part of the map like you can see in the figure2. Thymio will evolve on this map where there are two houses and four parking spots. Three of these spots will be occupied and only one of them will be free. There will be some \"dumb\" Thymio that will evolve in this map too, and our Thymio will have to avoid them, using Local Navigation. \n",

    "### 1.1 Computer vision and Kalman filter\n",
    "\n",
    "The camera allows us to implement the computer vision module. We use it to manage the Global Navigation. With the analysis of the video from the camera, we will extract the obstacles’ center position and their size, the parking slots, in addition to the position of the robot all along the road to its goal. The camera will give us the image with an RGB array where we will have all the pixels of the map. \n",
    "To implement the image processing, we essentially use the library  “ OpenCV”. This library includes very useful functions to extract data from a picture. As for the detection of the colors in the image, the work of the Youtube channel L42Project (the GitHub repository is https://github.com/L42Project/Tutoriels/tree/master/Divers/tutoriel36) was very helpful. We have also based our Kalman filter on this repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The main part of the vision was to detect the position of the robot at each iteration. This means the x and y robot positions as well as its orientation. In order to do this, we have put on the robot two purple/pink points to get a vector of the position. Therefore, the angle orientation is computed by finding the angle between the vector position and the x-axis. \n",
    "The detection of these points is based on the fact that the biggest purple/pink point on the map will be the bottom point of the robot, and the second biggest one is the top point of the robot. \n",
    "For this, we select all the purple/pink points larger than a certain area and we sort the points to find the two biggest. This is done with the help of the sort() methods from OpenCV.\n",
    "The mask for the blue and green shape is made with the methods from OpenCV findContour().\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Kalman as mentioned above is based on the Kalman Filter from the L42Project. However, we made several changes to adapt the code to our project. \n",
    "We have modified the matrix by giving the measure of the speed in the Observation matrix and to improve the prediction. There were some difficulties to find the good size of the matrix and the right values. But the main challenge was to have a Kalman filter which provides us coherent values when the camera has some quick moments of absence. To solve this problem, we use two different Kalman filters (one for each point on the robot) to be able to compute the orientation in case the camera cannot give it to us. Indeed, we need for our system the position and the orientation of the robot to set the speed of the wheels. And by knowing the position of the two points on the robot, we can identify a vector position and hence the angle with the x axis."

    "\n",
    "In this part, we will see how we set and use the map to compute the optimal path that the robot has to follow to arrive on a free parking slot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type of path calculation : We choose to implement the A* algorithm that we have seen during the course and the exercises.\n",
    "In order to do that, we had to transform the frame that the camera gives us to a grid of a desired lenght. \n",
    "Therefore, we will be using a \"square by side unity\" rather than \"pixel by side\". \n",
    "\n",
    "We chose the \"square by side\" to obtain not only a good precision, but also a low cost of calculation. As a consequence, we had to deal between those two parameters. After some testing, we chose a value of 50 squares for the smallest side. \n",
    "\n",
    "The steps below are the ones that we applied on the frame to obtain a final squared wanted grid with the obstacles on it : \n",
    "- Take the frame\n",
    "<img src=\"image/frame.jpg\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 400px;\"/>\n",
    "- Extract the obstacle from a mask to see only the blue (the obstacle) --> implemented by the vision part\n",

    "<img src=\"image/masque2.jpg\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 200px;\"/>\n",
    "- Expand the obstacle on the mask grid to add a security and avoid the robot collapsing with the obstacle\n",
    "<img src=\"image/secured.jpg\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 100px;\"/>\n",
    "- Resize the expanded mask grid to have a wanted squared dimension and no more pixels dimension. This is the final grid.\n",

    "- Compute the optimal path from the A* algorithm.\n",

    "\n",
    "We run this \"initialization\" one time before the \"running\" loop to avoid useless recomputation of the path each time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the optimal path has been computed, we defined the current goal as the next path point until we get to the final goal. We then have implemented a function to update the current goal to send to the control and movement part (see 1.3). \n",
    "Now the robot just has to follow the updated current goals.\n"

    "Once the vision module has been implemented in order to send all the positions needed, and the optimal path has been computed, we can now control the robot.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main function of this module (move_to_position) will continuously take as parameters the position of the robot and its angle which are given by the Vision module. The angle is in the range of [-pi, pi]. It also takes as parameters the continuously updated goals that are given by the Optimal Path module.\n",
    "\n",
    "This implemented function computes the error in position (which is the distance between the goal and the robot) and the error in angle (We were inspired by the function described in https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2827393/angles-between-two-n-dimensional-vectors-in-python to determine the angle of the goal. We changed it to be optimal to the variation we want from the robot.\n",
    "\n",
    "The angle is computed as a difference between the goal and the robot : if it's positif, then the robot should turn to the left, and if it's negatif, it should turn to the right, which is why we substract the angular error from the right motor speed, and add it to the left motor speed. \n",
    "\n",
    "In a more general way, the function \"move_to_position\" implements a PD (Proportionnal Derivative Controller), by adding a certain speed computed via the remaining distance (multiplied by an experimental coefficient) and adding/substracting an angular speed (multiplied by another experimental coefficient) to the motor's speed. These are added to some basic speed, because otherwise the speed of the robot will be almost zero when it reaches the updated goals. \n",

    "### 1.4 Local navigation and \"Dumb\" robot implementation\n",
    "We use the local navigation in order to avoid the other cars of the \"city\". Those other cars are the \"dumb\" Thymio in this project. Our principle is the following:\n",
    "<img src=\"image/MAIN_LN.jpg\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 400px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "We chose to make our Thymio go a little bit wider in order to let the \"Dumb\" Thymio leave without any collision. \n",
    "\n",
    "**We disable this avoid functionality when we will be arriving soon to the parking place** in order to make the parking maneuvers easier for Thymio. \n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation of the avoid function was inspired by the exercises of the course from the week 4. It means that we used the principle that when the robot \"sees\" an object in front of it, we accelerate the wheels near this obstacle. We don't use the external horizontal sensors because we would like to be able to follow walls. However, we use them to compute the value of the speed when there's an object detected. It allows us to be more precise (regarding our tests). As we don't want to see the walls too early (otherwise we could not follow the optimal path without interupting it all the time), we avoid obstacles at a very short distance. To be able to do that, we turn on the same spot and not \"smoothly\" like in the exercises. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also, we saved in a global variable if the robot saw an object on its right or on its left. The main reason is to help Thymio turn back if it is bloqued. The other reason is that it makes our turns \"cleaner\" when there's an object in one side if we turn on the same spot even if the left obstacle is far.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also computed differently our speed if there was an obstacle only in front of Thymio (otherwise it would have a very large turn and would often crash into the object). We kept the principle to compute the speed regarding the sensors values in order to give a smoother change of speed. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to check if there's no more obstacles in Thymio's way, we are checking the front and the two interior side sensors but not the external side ones in case we would be along a wall. \n",
    "\n",
    "We chose our thresholds by doing some tests with our Thymio and an object that we pushed in front of Thymio. We wrote down the results to help us find the best combination. You can find our table below:\n",
    "<img src=\"image/table_prox.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 400px;\"/>\n",

    "About the \"dumb\" robot implementation, it is developped in a different section below as we thought it was more logical that way. "

This helps the Thymio find again its line in case it had lost it (because it was going too fast). \n",

    "In conclusion, it was a very nice project and it went well. We were a good team and it was easy to work with each other. \n",
    "With this project, we had a good overview of what we can do in Python with a robot like Thymio. \n",
    "\n",
    "To have taken the course of \"Systèmes embarqués et robotique [MICRO-315]\" was very helpful for this project. Indeed, we were more comfortable with the \"researching\" aspects of the project, as we got more familiar with the methodology of how to look for the information we need. However, the most difficult part was the computer vision as it was new to us. \n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, this project showed us that the grid approach for path calculation or robot dynamic positioning is not adequate for a big map since the cost of calculation is a lot higher than an edge obstacle detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "To improve this project, we can change the way we do the calculations on the grid expansion or path calculation. We can imagine implemeting a Dijkstra algorithm for exemple."
